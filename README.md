# Horiseon Refactor to improve HTML and CSS semantics, accessibility, and search engine optimization.

## HTML Structure

 The HTML structure of the webpage is now organized as follows:
* Header: Contains the webpage title and navigation links.
* Main Content: Contains the primary content of the webpage.
* Aside: Showcases the benefits listed on the webpage.

The title and the alternative text throughout the webpage has been updated better accessibility and search engine optimization.
 
### CSS Styling

The CSS Styling has been organized according to CSS semantics and has been updated to remove any repeating elements with the same style.

#### Motivation

The motivation behind this challenge was to improve the HTML and CSS code on this webpage for better accessibility and search engine optimization. During this project I leared proper semantics and organization of the code and that for accessibility with images included on the webpage, there also needs to be alternative text in the html code.
